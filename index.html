				<p class="left-half-description">The time you spend with the people that matter most can't be replaced. Yet, we find ourselves saying the following all to often:
				<br>- "I had no idea you were even in town!"
				<br>- "We'll have to get together on of these weekends when we're both free" 
				<br>- "I would have texted you if I'd known you were going to be around!"
				<br>We miss countless opportunities everyday to spend time with the people that matter the most to us through a lack of transparency in our social schedules. If we simply had that real time information, we could be infinitely more efficient in making sure that we capitalize on those missed social opportunities and spend more, quality time with the people that matter the most to us. LookFwd provides that information, in an intuitive solution. Get ready to make more memories with your friends.</p>
